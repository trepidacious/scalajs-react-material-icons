# scalajs-react-material-icons
Scalajs react facade for material-ui icons

Each icon is a separate component, as in original js project.

Icon names are taken from the .js files in the material-ui icons package src folder.

Only the standard versions are present - this is already a huge number of classes.

## TODO

1. Have a look at https://gist.github.com/AmirOfir/daee915574b1ba0d877da90777dc2181 to see whether we can split icons into categories.
2. Consider producing a project for each icon version.
3. Implement props if any.
